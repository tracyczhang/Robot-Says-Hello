# Robot-Says-Hello

Code for Wizard of Oz (WoZ) control of the BWI Bots and Speech-to-Text transcription capabilities.

Thus, the robot appears to be autonomous but is actually humanly-controlled
(usually from a remote location), allowing for a researcher to control its
movements and response speech as it transcribes all human-robot interactions
and/or dialogues that take place.
