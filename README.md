# Robot-Says-Hello

Program written for the Wizard of Oz (WoZ) control of the BWI Bots
(where the robot appears to be autonomous but is actually humanly-controlled,
usually from a remote location). This allows for a researcher to control the
movement and response speech of the BWI Bot as it transcribes human-robot
interactions and dialogues that take place.
